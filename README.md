# Wit Test - React Native

## This test was made with React-Native and Styled Components. 
<br>
To run it, start your emulator, open the project in VS Code and install the dependencies with ``` yarn ```.
After that, you only need to type ``` yarn android ``` for it to run on your device.

<br>
A few details:

- Key: the apiFetch.js file has 2 keys for testing.

- The project was made with a Google Pixel 3a.

- Since AccuWeather does not show the probability of rain in the day fetch, it is static. I believe that I showed throughout the code that I can consume the JSON that is being fetched, so, IMHO, that's a minor if.

- Since AccuWeather asks for 40+ icons, I used a few from React-Native Icons, just to illustrate how I would come about doing it in real life.

- I used AccuWeather for this project. And, strangely enough, AccuWeather does not recognize Dublin for some reason, so I changed the city name for a random one.

- There's a lot of room for improvement, but, because of time constraints this is the finish product. 

<br>
Time report:

- Since it's asked a time frame in the rules of the test: I had only a day to do this. I used about 10 to 12 hours to do it.

- Objectives completed: 2 screens, 1 showing cities, 1 showing 5 days of forecast.
